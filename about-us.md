# About Us

Silkstone Common Miners Welfare FC was founded in 1926 when local miners accessed welfare funds to purchase a patch of land in Hall Royd Wood and cleared the trees to
create a football pitch. Following pit closures, ownership of the recreation and sports ground passed to Barnsley Council from British Coal in the 1990s.

Fire destroyed the club’s pavilion and facilities in 1996, which was a great blow for both our community and the club. SCMWFC played their last 
game there in 2002.

The club’s revival in 2022 was thanks to Silkstone Common Sports and Recreation Association which was set up to bring the outdoor space and football club back to life and improve its facilities. Further development of the recreation ground is planned for the near future.
